# Model-Averaging

This is a repository for the joint lab meeting project to work through the Dormann et al. paper on model averaging.

Two datasets were created: one with a Bernoulli response and one with a Normal response. Each dataset has a number of potential predictor variables. The task is to create model-averaged estimates of predictions using the methods described in Dormann et al.
